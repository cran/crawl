Johnson\nMaintainer: Devin S. Johnson <devin.johnson@noaa.gov>\nDepends: R (>= 2.4.0), mvtnorm\nDescription: The (C)orrelated (RA)ndom (W)alk (L)ibrary of R functions was designed for fitting continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed covariates. The model is fit using the Kalman-Filter on a state space version of the continuous-time stochastic movement process.   \nLicense: Unlimited\nLazyLoad: yes\n",
